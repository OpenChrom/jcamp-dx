0.9.2
-----
New:
* added JCAMPReader.createSpectrum(Reader) method
* code cleanup
  * introduced serialVersionUIDs
  * replaced StringBuffer with StringBuilder
* can be built using Apache Maven now as well
* JCAMPReader now has a STRICT and RELAXED mode. For documentation, 
  see STRICT constant in JCAMPReader. Further usages of this flag 
  should add documentation there.

Fixes:
* numeric values in header can be format "#.#" or "#,#" now
* Labels in a comment (like $$ ##TITLE=) confused the parser
* The parser reader now shows same behaviour with respect to units 
  first and second time (this influenced if hertz-ppm-conversion was 
  done in nmr, so rather big effects)
