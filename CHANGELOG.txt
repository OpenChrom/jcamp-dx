New:
* can be build using Apache Maven now as well
* JCAMPReader now has a STRICT and RELAXED mode. For documentation, see STRICT constant in JCAMPReader. Further 
usages of this flag should add documentation there.

Fixes:
* numeric values in header can be format "#.#" or "#,#" now
* Labels in a comment (like $$ ##TITLE=) confused the parser
* The parser reader now shows same behaviour with respect to units first and second time (this influenced if hertz-ppm-conversion was done in nmr, so rather big effects)
* Reading of floats in XYDATA not works (thanks to Ralf Tralow for that)
